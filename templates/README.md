## 🎓 **Best Practices**

**Planning Docs:**
- ✅ Architecture-first (not feature-first)
- ✅ Show examples (code > words)
- ✅ List anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
- ✅ Keep updated (living documents)
- ❌ Don't prescribe implementation details
- ❌ Don't assume agent knowledge

**Task Files:**
- ✅ Small scope (2-8 hours)
- ✅ Clear boundaries (owned paths)
- ✅ Testable criteria
- ✅ Reference planning docs
- ❌ Don't overlap with other tasks
- ❌ Don't leave integration unclear
