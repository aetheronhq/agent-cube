    "Writer A failed architectural compliance by modifying project configuration files, which is a critical failure and disqualifies the submission."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Writer B is the winner due to strict adherence to architectural constraints. However, the final version should synthesize the best parts of both submissions: use Writer B as the base, but incorporate Writer A's more concise 'capitalize' function, its JSDoc examples, and its more exhaustive test cases for certain functions."
