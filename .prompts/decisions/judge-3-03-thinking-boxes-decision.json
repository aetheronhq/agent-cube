  "recommendation": "Both implementations were excellent and fully met the requirements. Writer B (Codex) is chosen as the winner due to a slightly more polished and robust implementation. Key advantages included a more scalable color mapping strategy, stricter TypeScript definitions, and better organization of type interfaces. These details, while minor, contribute to a more maintainable and professional codebase."
