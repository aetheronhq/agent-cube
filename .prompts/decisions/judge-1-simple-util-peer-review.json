    "Optional: Add Writer A's additional test cases for enhanced coverage (capitalize: 2 tests, truncate: 2 tests, slugify: 4 tests) to bring total from 18 to ~35 tests",
    "Specific tests to consider: 'handles single uppercase character', 'handles mixed case strings', 'correctly counts ellipsis in maxLength', 'handles already slug-like strings', 'removes leading hyphens', 'removes trailing hyphens', 'handles numbers in slugs'",
    "Note: Current 18-test coverage is already sufficient for production use; this enhancement is purely optional"
  ],
  "rationale": "Writer B's implementation achieves perfect architecture compliance (exactly 3 files modified, zero config changes), demonstrates functionally correct implementations with proper edge case handling (including defensive Math.max for negative values), and provides sufficient test coverage with 18 comprehensive tests. Code quality is excellent with strong type safety, clear JSDoc documentation, and K.I.S.S compliance. The optional synthesis recommendation to add Writer A's tests was not applied, but this is acceptable as it was explicitly marked optional."
