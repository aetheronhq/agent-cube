  "recommendation": "Writer A provides superior test coverage (29 comprehensive test cases vs 18) with exceptional edge case testing, particularly for slugify. Both implementations are K.I.S.S-compliant, architecturally sound, and functionally correct. Writer B's negative maxLength handling is a nice touch but doesn't outweigh Writer A's significantly more thorough test suite. Recommend Writer A with optional synthesis to add Writer B's maxLength <= 0 explicit check and emoji test case."
