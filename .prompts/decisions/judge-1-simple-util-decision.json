    "Writer A: Failed architecture compliance by modifying 8 files (package.json, tsconfig.json, vitest.config.ts, .gitignore, package-lock.json) when only 3 files should be modified. Task explicitly required 'No configuration changes'."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Writer B followed requirements precisely by only modifying the 3 required files. Implementation is functionally correct, clean, and includes defensive coding (Math.max for negative values). While Writer A had superior test coverage (35 vs 18 tests), the architecture violation is disqualifying. Recommend synthesis: use Writer B as base and add Writer A's additional test cases for comprehensive coverage without configuration changes."
