  "blocker_issues": [
    "Writer A reimplements decision parsing and fabricates synthesis data instead of using cube.core.decision_files.read_decision_file, so the API contract and data are incorrect.",
    "Writer B imports cube.core.decision_files.read_decision_file, but that helper is undefined, so the backend crashes on startup with ImportError."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Writer B stays closer to the requested architecture and UI, but must supply or import a real read_decision_file implementation; Writer A needs to rebuild the endpoint to use the provided helpers and return real decision data."
