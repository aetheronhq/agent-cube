      "strengths": [
        "Backend endpoint works correctly using parse_all_decisions and aggregate_decisions",
        "Excellent error handling with proper HTTP status codes and try/except blocks",
        "All three components created with proper TypeScript types and JSX.Element return types",
        "TypeScript compiles with zero errors - clean implementation",
        "Comprehensive decision summary showing consensus, aggregated scores, and blocker issues",
        "Proper conditional rendering of synthesis and optional fields",
        "Named exports throughout, no default exports"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Used decision_parser instead of the non-existent read_decision_file (though this was actually correct)",
        "Backend transforms data structure extensively rather than returning it directly",
        "Generates synthetic 'synthesis' data when not present in actual decisions - this is misleading",
        "Added extra fields (consensus, aggregated scores, blocker issues) to decision summary beyond requirements",
        "Shows vote as string rather than the union type in JudgeVote interface",
        "Modified stream.py file which was not required for this task"
      ],
      "critical_issues": [
        "Backend creates fake synthesis instructions and bestBits when synthesis doesn't exist - violates truthfulness requirement",

      "recommendation": "REQUEST_CHANGES",
      "summary": "Writer A created a fully functional implementation with excellent TypeScript and error handling. However, the backend endpoint manipulates and transforms data too much, creating synthetic synthesis data when none exists. While the code works and compiles cleanly, it goes beyond KISS principles by adding extra complexity and returning fabricated data."

        "Excellent TypeScript implementation with proper union types for votes",

      "weaknesses": [

However, the backend is completely broken due to importing a non-existent function (read_decision_file). The code cannot run at all and would crash immediately. Despite excellent frontend work, this is a fundamental failure that makes the implementation unusable."

    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "This is a clear-cut decision despite Writer B having superior frontend code. Writer B's backend has a fatal import error that prevents the entire implementation from running. The prompt instructed writers to use read_decision_file from cube.core.decision_files, but this function doesn't exist - it was misleading instruction. Writer A correctly adapted by using the actual available functions (parse_all_decisions and aggregate_decisions). However, Writer A also has issues: it fabricates synthesis data when none exists, which violates data integrity principles. Writer A needs to fix the synthetic data generation and return actual decision data without embellishment.",
    "next_steps": [
      "SELECT Writer A as the base implementation (only working backend)",
      "Writer A must REMOVE synthetic synthesis generation - only show synthesis when it actually exists in decisions",
      "Writer A should simplify backend response to return decisions more directly without heavy transformation",
      "Consider incorporating Writer B's superior frontend patterns: vote summaries, consensus calculation, AbortController",
      "Writer B's frontend code quality, UX patterns, and TypeScript types should be used as reference for improvements",
      "Fix: Remove fake bestBits arrays and synthesis instructions when aggregated decision has no synthesis",
      "Verify backend returns truthful data matching actual decision file contents"
