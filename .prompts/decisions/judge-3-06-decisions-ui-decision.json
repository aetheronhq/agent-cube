  "recommendation": "Writer B (Codex) is the clear winner. Its implementation is correct, robust, and adheres strictly to the architectural principles of the project. It delivers a simple, effective data endpoint and a well-crafted frontend that correctly processes and displays the information. Writer A (Sonnet), while having a visually appealing frontend, suffers from a critical architectural flaw in the backend. By reimplementing logic and fabricating data, it violates the core requirements and introduces unnecessary complexity and potential for bugs."
