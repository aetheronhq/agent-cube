      "strengths": [
        "All functional requirements met perfectly - all 4 files created with correct structure",
        "Clean, simple implementation following KISS principles with no over-engineering",
        "Excellent commit message with detailed bullet points explaining all changes",
        "TypeScript compiles without errors, no console.log statements or commented code"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Color selection logic uses nested ternary operators which could be harder to maintain as more colors are added",
        "Types file is minimal - doesn't export DualLayoutProps or TripleLayoutProps interfaces (defined inline instead)",

      "summary": "Writer A (Sonnet) delivers a solid, production-ready implementation that meets all requirements with clean code and excellent documentation. The implementation is simple, follows KISS principles perfectly, and demonstrates strong attention to detail in the commit message. Minor improvements could be made to color handling structure, but these are not blockers."

      "strengths": [
        "Excellent code structure with COLOR_VARIANTS constant making color management maintainable and extensible",
        "Superior type definitions with strict union types for colors and comprehensive interfaces exported",
        "Explicit JSX.Element return types throughout, excellent TypeScript hygiene",
        "Beautiful color choices (emerald/sky) with transparency and transition effects for polished UX"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Commit message is generic auto-commit style, lacking detail about implementation",
        "Minor deduction: whitespace-pre-wrap and break-words may not match CLI's exact text handling behavior",
        "Additional classes like transition-colors and shadow-sm add slight complexity beyond strict requirements"
      ],
      "critical_issues": [],
      "recommendation": "APPROVED",
      "summary": "Writer B (Codex) delivers an exemplary implementation with superior code organization and type safety. The COLOR_VARIANTS pattern demonstrates strong software engineering practices, and the strict TypeScript types enhance maintainability. The visual polish with transparency and transitions is a nice touch. Only weakness is the generic commit message."

  "comparison": {
    "better_implementation": "writer_b",
    "rationale": "While both implementations are excellent and production-ready, Writer B edges ahead with superior code organization (COLOR_VARIANTS constant), stricter TypeScript types (union types for colors), and better maintainability. The visual polish with emerald/sky colors and subtle transitions demonstrates attention to UX details. Writer A has a better commit message, but code quality tips the balance.",
    "key_differences": [
      "Code Organization: Writer B uses COLOR_VARIANTS constant vs Writer A's inline ternary operators - B is more maintainable",
      "Type Safety: Writer B exports all layout prop interfaces with strict union types, Writer A defines them inline with string type",
      "Visual Design: Writer B uses emerald/sky with opacity and transitions, Writer A uses standard green/blue - both work but B is more polished",
      "Documentation: Writer A has detailed commit message, Writer B has generic auto-commit - A wins here"
    ]
  },
  "panel_recommendation": {
    "final_decision": "APPROVED",
    "selected_writer": "writer_b",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "Both implementations meet all functional requirements and demonstrate strong technical competence. Writer B's implementation shows slightly better software engineering practices with the COLOR_VARIANTS pattern, stricter TypeScript types, and exported interfaces that will benefit future tasks. The code is more maintainable and extensible. Writer A's implementation is also excellent with better documentation, but in a panel review, code quality and maintainability take precedence over commit message quality. Both deserve approval, but Writer B's code structure makes it the recommended choice for merging.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Merge writer-codex/03-thinking-boxes branch into main",
      "Consider asking Writer B to improve commit message quality in future tasks",
      "Acknowledge Writer A's excellent commit message as a model for documentation",
      "Both implementations are production-ready and either could be used successfully"
