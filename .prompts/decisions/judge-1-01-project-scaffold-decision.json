      "summary": "Writer A delivers a solid, production-ready implementation that meets all functional requirements. The project structure is clean, dependencies are minimal, and the dark theme is implemented perfectly. However, the TypeScript implementation could be more rigorous with explicit return types and null handling."

The code quality demonstrates strong TypeScript expertise that will benefit maintainability in future tasks. Uses stable Tailwind v3."

While both implementations are production-ready and meet all requirements, Writer B's explicit return types, proper type imports, and defensive null handling show a deeper understanding of TypeScript best practices. These choices will make the codebase more maintainable and reduce potential bugs in future development.",
    "key_differences": [
      "Type Safety: Writer B uses explicit JSX.Element return types on all components and 'import type' syntax; Writer A omits these",

      "TypeScript Config: Writer B includes explicit noImplicitAny and strictNullChecks flags; Writer A relies on strict mode defaults",
      "Navigation Enhancement: Writer B adds sticky positioning to navigation bar; Writer A uses standard positioning",

    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "Both implementations successfully complete the task with zero blocking issues. However, Writer B's implementation stands out for its exceptional TypeScript practices. The explicit return types, proper type imports, and defensive null handling demonstrate coding discipline that will prevent bugs and improve maintainability. Writer B also adds a small UX enhancement (sticky navigation) without violating KISS principles. While Writer A's implementation is solid and production-ready, Writer B's superior type safety makes it the clear winner for a TypeScript-focused project.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Merge Writer B's implementation as the project foundation",
      "Use Writer B's TypeScript patterns as the standard for future tasks",
      "Document the type safety patterns (explicit return types, import type, null coalescing) for other writers",
      "Both writers should be commended for clean, minimal implementations that follow KISS principles"
