  "blocker_issues": [
    "Both implementations assume the tasks API returns a `phase` field and statuses limited to 'active'/'completed'/'failed', but the backend exposes `current_phase` and workflow status strings like 'in-progress' or 'writers-complete'. As a result the dashboards render 'undefined/10' progress, NaN% bars, and incorrect active/completed counts, so the core functionality requires correction."
  ],
  "recommendation": "Writer A is slightly closer thanks to simpler state handling, but both branches must align their task mapping with the real API before shipping."
