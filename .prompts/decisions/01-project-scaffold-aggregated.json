Both writers produced excellent, nearly identical scaffolds that perfectly matched the requirements. Writer B (Codex) has a very slight edge due to more explicit TypeScript return types on all components (`JSX.Element`) and a minor piece of defensive coding in the `TaskDetail` component. These small details demonstrate a slightly higher level of polish and robustness. The only shared, minor omission was the lack of example navigation links for all routes, which is trivial to add.\", timestamp='2025-11-11T20:00:00Z')"
