      "strengths": [
        "Clean, readable implementation following KISS principles",
        "All core requirements met: task list, status overview, auto-refresh, navigation",
        "Proper TypeScript types with no 'any' types",
        "Correct progress bar calculation and status badge colors",
        "TypeScript compiles cleanly with no errors"

      "weaknesses": [
        "No abort controller for fetch requests - could cause issues if component unmounts during fetch",
        "Error state lacks a retry button for user recovery",
        "Loading state is basic text without visual spinner",

      "recommendation": "APPROVED",
      "summary": "Solid implementation that meets all functional requirements with clean, maintainable code. The core functionality is correct with proper cleanup of the interval timer. Minor improvements could be made to error handling and UI polish, but no blocking issues."

      "branch": "writer-codex/04-dashboard",

      "strengths": [
        "Exceptional cleanup with abort controllers preventing race conditions and memory leaks",
        "Excellent error handling with retry button and user-friendly error states",
        "More polished UI: animated loading spinner, better empty state design, status indicator",
        "Superior accessibility: semantic button element for TaskCard with proper focus states",
        "Defensive programming: array validation, phase clamping, finite number checks",
        "Better code organization: constants for magic numbers (POLL_INTERVAL_MS), useMemo for computed values"
      ],
      "weaknesses": [
        "Slightly more complex than necessary with useCallback, useMemo, and refs (but justified by quality gains)",
        "Additional complexity with isMountedRef pattern (though this prevents common React bugs)"

      "recommendation": "APPROVED",
      "summary": "Exceptional implementation that exceeds requirements with production-ready code quality. Demonstrates deep understanding of React best practices, proper cleanup patterns, and accessibility. The additional complexity is well-justified by the robustness gains. This is exemplary work."

  "comparison": {
    "better_implementation": "writer_b",
    "rationale": "While both implementations are functionally correct and meet requirements, Writer B demonstrates significantly better engineering practices. The abort controller pattern prevents race conditions, the retry button improves UX, and the defensive programming makes the code more robust. Writer B's implementation is production-ready while Writer A is MVP-ready.",
    "key_differences": [
      "Writer B uses abort controllers and refs for proper cleanup; Writer A only cleans up the interval",
      "Writer B has animated loading spinner and retry button; Writer A has basic text states",
      "Writer B uses semantic button element for TaskCard with focus states; Writer A uses div with onClick",
      "Writer B includes defensive programming (array checks, phase clamping); Writer A assumes valid data",
      "Writer B extracts constants and uses useMemo for computed values; Writer A has inline calculations"
    ]
  },
  "panel_recommendation": {
    "final_decision": "APPROVED",
    "selected_writer": "writer_b",
    "confidence": "high",
    "reasoning": "Both implementations successfully complete the task and compile cleanly with proper TypeScript types. However, Writer B's implementation is significantly more robust and production-ready. The abort controller pattern prevents common React bugs around unmounting components, the retry button improves error recovery UX, and the semantic HTML with proper accessibility is better for users. Writer B also demonstrates better defensive programming with input validation and edge case handling. While Writer A is a solid MVP implementation, Writer B represents the quality we should expect in production code. The additional complexity in Writer B is minimal and well-justified by the robustness gains.",
    "next_steps": [
      "Merge writer-codex/04-dashboard implementation to main",
      "Writer B's implementation should be used as the reference for future tasks",
      "Consider documenting Writer B's abort controller pattern as a best practice for the team",
      "No changes required - implementation is production-ready"
