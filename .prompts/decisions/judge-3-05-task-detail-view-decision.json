  "recommendation": "Writer A (Sonnet) is the clear winner. Their implementation is a textbook example of how to correctly solve the problem. It is simple, elegant, robust, and directly follows the architectural guidance. Writer B's implementation, while featuring a very strong frontend, is built on a critically flawed backend architecture involving global state and monkey-patching, making it fragile and unmaintainable."
