  "recommendation": "Both implementations are excellent and meet all requirements. Writer B (Codex) is chosen as the winner due to slightly more robust error handling, better code structure for future expansion, and a more flexible feedback API that accepts both file paths and raw text. The differences are minor, and both are of high quality, but Writer B's solution is marginally more polished and production-ready."
