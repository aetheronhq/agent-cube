  "recommendation": "Writer A (Sonnet) is the clear winner. The implementation is simple, clean, and directly follows the architectural guidelines and KISS principles outlined in the prompt. It meets all functional requirements correctly. Writer B's implementation, while having a more polished UI and being technically robust, was significantly over-engineered for the scope of the task, violating the core principle of simplicity. Writer A's code is far more maintainable and a better fit for the project's current stage."
