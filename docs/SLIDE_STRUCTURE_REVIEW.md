## ✅ **ASSESSMENT: EXCELLENT STRUCTURE**

### **What Works:**

**✅ Story Arc:**
```
Hook (1-3) → Concept (4-6) → Process (7-8) → 
Science (9) → Results (10-13) → Data (14) → 
Practice (15) → Future (16)
```

**✅ Pacing:**
- Fast start (hook in 2 min)
- Technical middle (build credibility)
- Proof (v2 results)
- Actionable end (commands)

**✅ Balance:**
- Inspiration: Slides 1-6
- Education: Slides 7-9
- Proof: Slides 10-14
- Action: Slides 15-16

## 🔧 **RECOMMENDED TWEAKS**

### **Add: Slide 14.5 - Human-in-Loop**

**Insert between Audit Trail and Commands:**

```
HUMAN-IN-THE-LOOP

Agent Cube guides, doesn't replace:

Common interventions:
• Judge doesn't save decision
  → cube resume judge-3 task "Write JSON"

• Synthesis needs iteration
  → Tool shows exact command

• Architecture validation
  → Human reviews final PR

The tool tells you:
✅ When it needs help
✅ Exactly what to do
✅ How to recover

Goal: 5 interventions today → 1-2 next quarter

Continuous improvement through:
• Better prompts
• Smarter defaults  
• Learning from data

But always: Human validates final merge
```

**Why add this:**
- Sets realistic expectations
- Shows you're honest
- Prevents "magic tool" misconception
- Positions for future improvements

### **Update: Slide 3 - Add Web UI**

**Current:**
```
v2 Metrics
```

**Better:**
```
REAL RESULTS

v2: 15 features / 11 days
Web UI: 5 tasks / 3 hours (built TODAY!)

Cost: $[X] for Web UI

Human time: ~5 interventions
Agent time: 3 hours autonomous
```

**Why:**
- Shows fresh proof (today!)
- Includes cost (transparency)
- Shows human involvement (honesty)

## 🎬 **DEMO INTEGRATION**

**Slide 3 → Start Demo**
```
"Speaking of building fast...
Let me show you the Cube building its own UI.
Right now. Today's recording."

[Start Loom]
```

**Demo runs through slides 4-9**
(You narrate over slides during demo pauses)

**Slide 10 → Back to slides**
Results, practical, future
