## 🎯 **THE ASK**

**Keep it simple:**

   - Pick something small (2-4 hours)
   - Run `cube auto`
   - See what happens

2. **Raise GitHub issues**
   - Bugs, ideas, questions
   - Cube will help fix them!

3. **Share feedback**
   - What worked?
   - What confused you?
   - What would make it better?

**Goal:** 5+ people try it by next week

## 🎤 **PRESENTATION TIPS**

**Energy:**
- Start strong (metrics hook)
- Vary pace (fast demos, slow concepts)
- Pause for reactions
- Interactive questions

**Stories:**
- Use specific examples (Error Handler, API Client)
- "Judge 2 caught this bug..."
- "Synthesis combined the best..."
- Make it real, not abstract

**Technical Balance:**
- Assume smart audience
- Explain jargon once
- Show code briefly
- Focus on outcomes

**Confidence:**
- You built this!
- You've used it extensively
- You have the data
- Trust your expertise
