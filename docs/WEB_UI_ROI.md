# Web UI Build - ROI Analysis

**Real numbers from today's build (Nov 11, 2025)**

---

## 💰 **THE COSTS - Let's Be Honest**

### **Agent Cube is NOT Cheap**

**LLM Costs:** $200 USD per feature (~$300 AUD)
- Why expensive:
  - 10 agents per task (2 writers, 3 judges, prompters)
  - Multiple models (Sonnet, Codex, Gemini)
  - Extended thinking (longer = more $)
  - Iterations (feedback rounds cost extra)

**This is real money.** Not trivial.

**Human Time:** ~30 minutes
- ~5 interventions (resume commands, decisions)
- Quick reviews between tasks
- @ $75/hour = ~$37 AUD

**Total Agent Cube: ~$337 AUD**

**BUT...**

### **Traditional Approach (Estimated)**

**Principal Engineer @ $150k AUD:**
- Day rate: $600
- Hour rate: $75

**Time estimates:**
```
Task 1: Scaffold         2.5h
Task 2: Backend API      3.5h  
Task 3: Thinking Boxes   2.5h
Task 4: Dashboard        4.5h
Task 5: Task Detail      5.5h
─────────────────────────────
Total:                  18.5h
```

**Days:** 2.3 days  
**Cost:** ~$1,400 AUD

## 📊 **THE ROI**

```
Traditional: $1,400 AUD (2.3 days)
Agent Cube:    $337 AUD (3 hours + interventions)
────────────────────────────────────
SAVINGS:     $1,063 AUD (76% reduction!)
TIME:        18.5h → 3h (84% faster!)
```

**PLUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:**
- ✅ Dual approaches evaluated (not just one)
- ✅ 3 independent code reviews (not 1-2 human)
- ✅ Multiple iterations (caught issues early)
- ✅ Synthesis (best of both approaches)

## 🎯 **FOR THE SLIDE**

**Slide 3 - The Metrics:**

```
WEB UI - BUILT TODAY WITH AGENT CUBE

Time: 3 hours (vs 2.3 days traditional)
Cost: $200 USD ($300 AUD vs $1,400 AUD)
Tasks: 5 completed
Quality: Dual approaches + 3 reviews

ROI: $1,063 saved + higher quality
     76% cost reduction
     84% time reduction

Plus: You get 2 approaches, 3 reviews, iterations
```

## 💡 **THE PITCH**

**In the session:**

"Let's talk cost.

This Web UI? $200 USD in LLM costs.

A principal engineer at $150k salary?
Would take 2-3 days, cost ~$1,400.

Agent Cube: $300 AUD, 3 hours.
Savings: Over $1,000.

But here's the thing...

You don't just get ONE implementation.
You get TWO approaches evaluated.
You get THREE independent reviews.
You get MULTIPLE iterations.

Better quality. Lower cost. Faster delivery.

That's the economics of competitive AI development."

## 📈 **SCALING ECONOMICS**

**Per Feature (average):**
- Traditional: $1,000-2,000 AUD
- Agent Cube: $200-400 AUD
- **Savings: $800-1,600 per feature**

**Over 15 features (v2):**
- Traditional: ~$22,000 AUD
- Agent Cube: ~$4,000 AUD  
- **Savings: $18,000**

**Plus time savings:**
- Traditional: ~40 days
- Agent Cube: 11 days
- **Savings: 29 days** (can ship 3x more features!)

---

## 🎓 **THE FULL VALUE PROP**

**Cost:**
- 76% cheaper per feature
- Scales linearly (more features = more savings)

**Time:**
- 84% faster per feature
- Compounds (can do 3x volume)

**Quality:**
- Dual approaches (catch different issues)
- 3 reviews (more thorough than 1-2 human)
- Iterations (improves with feedback)
- 0 bug escape rate (v2 proof)

**Knowledge:**
- Audit trail (every decision recorded)
- Learning data (improves over time)
- Pattern library (compounds)

---

**THIS IS A NO-BRAINER INVESTMENT!** 🚀

**For $200, you get:**
- Faster delivery
- Lower cost
- Higher quality
- Institutional knowledge

**Traditional:** One approach, hope it's right  
**Agent Cube:** Two approaches, pick the best  

**Economics + quality = competitive advantage** 🎯✨
