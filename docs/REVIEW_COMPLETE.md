## 🔥 **WHAT COULD GO WRONG?**

**Potential Issues:**

**1. Demo fails**
- ✅ Solution: Pre-recorded backup ready
- ✅ Can narrate from screenshots

**2. Too technical**
- ✅ Solution: Jargon explained
- ✅ Focus on outcomes not internals

**3. Runs long**
- ✅ Solution: Timing marks in outline
- ✅ Can skip Q&A setup (just "Slack me")

**4. Questions derail**
- ✅ Solution: "Great question - let's discuss after"
- ✅ Save deep-dives for end

**5. Skepticism**
- ✅ Solution: Real data ready
- ✅ Honest about limitations
- ✅ Human-in-loop emphasized

**All risks mitigated!**
