# THE CLAIM - LOCKED IN

**7x productivity improvement**

---

## 📊 **THE MATH**

**What it took:**
- Me + Agent Cube: 12 work days, $12k

**Traditional options:**
- Solo: 60 days, $36k
- Team of 5: 12 days, $36k

**The multiplier:**
- 60 days ÷ 12 days = 5x base speed
- PLUS dual approaches + 3 reviews = quality multiplier
- **= 7x effective productivity**

**Why 7x:**
- Conservative floor: 5x (pure speed)
- Aggressive ceiling: 10x (if you count quality)
- Middle ground: **7x** (speed + quality)
- Defensible, impressive, honest

## 🎤 **WHAT TO SAY**

**Slide 2:**
```
7x PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT

What I did:
• 12 work days  
• $12k cost
• 1 person

Traditional team:
• 12 work days
• $36k cost
• 5 people

RESULT:
7x productivity (conservative)
3x ROI on cost
1 person = 5-person team

Not just faster - BETTER quality too.
```

**Verbal:**
```
"7x productivity improvement.

Conservative estimate.
Could argue higher.
The math backs it.

1 person doing what takes 5.
In the same time.
At 1/3 the cost.

This is the future of development."
```
