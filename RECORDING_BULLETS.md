# Recording Bullets - Narrate Planning Process

**What to say while agent plans the Web UI**

---

## 🎬 **LOOM NARRATION SCRIPT**

### **Opening** (10 seconds)
- "Let me show you how Agent Cube plans new features"
- "We're going to build a web UI for the Cube itself"
- "Watch as the planning process unfolds"

### **Launch Command** (5 seconds)
```
I'm giving this agent the Web UI requirements
And asking it to create the architecture plan and task breakdown
```

### **Prompter Appears** (30 seconds)
- "First, a Prompter agent reads the requirements"
- "It's thinking about the architecture"
- "Notice it's reading the existing codebase"
- "Understanding the current terminal implementation"
- "Figuring out how to translate this to a web UI"

### **Dual Writers Launch** (1 minute)
**When thinking boxes appear:**
- "Now two agents propose different approaches"
- "Writer A (Sonnet) - notice it's thinking about simplicity"
- "Writer B (Codex) - focusing on completeness"
- "They're both creating planning docs and task files"
- "Different architectural choices emerging..."

**When tool calls show:**
- "Writer A creating files... minimalist approach"
- "Writer B creating files... more comprehensive"
- "Both valid, both different - that's the point"

### **Judge Panel** (1 minute, speed up)
- "Now 3 independent judges review both plans"
- "Judge 1 checking KISS compliance"
- "Judge 2 analyzing completeness"
- "Judge 3 verifying production-readiness"
- [Speed through most of this]

### **Decision** (30 seconds)
**When cube decide shows:**
- "Aggregating the votes..."
- "Winner: [A or B] - [score] vs [score]"
- "Next: Synthesis to combine best of both"
- OR "Clear winner, moving to peer review"

### **Synthesis** (if needed, 30 seconds)
- "Now the winner addresses judge feedback"
- "Taking the best parts of the losing approach"
- "This is where quality compounds"

### **Result** (20 seconds)
- "And there we have it"
- "Complete architecture plan: planning/web-ui.md"
- "6 task files ready to execute"
- "From requirements to executable plan in [X] minutes"
- "Zero human planning time"

### **Closing** (10 seconds)
- "This is how we work now"
- "Agents plan, agents build, judges review"
- "Humans validate and merge"
- "Let's see what they created..."

## 🎯 **KEY POINTS TO EMPHASIZE**

### **During Launch:**
✅ "This is the planning process"
✅ "Agent reads requirements and codebase"
✅ "Two competing approaches"

### **During Writers:**
✅ "Different architectural choices"
✅ "Both valid, both different"
✅ "Watch the thinking boxes - see their reasoning"

### **During Judges:**
✅ "3 independent reviews"
✅ "Different perspectives"
✅ [Can speed through most of this]

### **At Decision:**
✅ "Aggregated votes"
✅ "Data-driven selection"
✅ "OR synthesis combines best of both"

### **At End:**
✅ "Complete plan in [X] minutes"
✅ "Ready to execute"
✅ "Zero human planning time"

## ⏱️ **TIMING**

**Total target:** ~10 minutes final video

**Recording:** ~20-30 minutes (will speed up)

**Speed up:**
- Writers thinking (10x faster)
- Judges reviewing (10x faster)

**Normal speed:**
- Your narration
- Launch moment
- Decision reveal
- Results peek

---

## 🎨 **VISUAL CUES**

**Point out:**
- "See the dual thinking boxes"
- "Notice the different file structures"
- "Watch the tool calls - they're reading the codebase"
- "This is what competitive planning looks like"

**When to pause:**
- Decision is revealed
- Quick peek at generated files
- Final summary

---

## 🎭 **TONE**

- Conversational (not scripted)
- Enthusiastic (this is cool!)
- Educational (explain what's happening)
- Confident (this works!)

**Energy curve:**
- Start: Medium (setting up)
- Middle: High (writers competing!)
- Decision: Peak (reveal!)
- End: Satisfied (look what we got)

---

## 🎯 **THE MONEY LINE**

**At the end:**

"And that's the Agent Cube planning process.

From idea to executable plan in [X] minutes.
Two competing approaches evaluated by three judges.
The result: A comprehensive architecture and 6 ready-to-build tasks.

This is how we work now.
Agents plan. Agents build. Judges review. Humans validate.

Tomorrow, we'll run these tasks and build the actual UI.
But first, the planning had to be perfect.

And it is."
