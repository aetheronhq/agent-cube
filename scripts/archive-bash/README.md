# Archived Bash Implementation

This directory contains the original bash implementation of Agent Cube.

**Status:** Deprecated - replaced by Python implementation

The bash version was the MVP and proof of concept. It has been superseded by the Python implementation which offers:

- Ports & adapters architecture
- Gemini CLI integration
- Config-driven model selection
- Automated decision parsing
- Autonomous orchestration
- Rich Layout teleprompts

**The main `cube` script is now a simple wrapper that calls `cube-py`.**

For reference only.
