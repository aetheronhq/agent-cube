## 🤖 The Agent Cube has become sentient!

Built itself a CLI tool to orchestrate parallel LLM coding workflows:

**How it works:**
→ 2 LLMs code solutions independently in parallel
→ 3 LLM judges review and vote for the winner
→ Winner synthesizes best of both approaches
→ Peer review validates → PR for human approval

**Bonus:** Optional Jira integration + works with any planning docs (OpenSpec.dev format = 🎯)

**Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aetheronhq/agent-cube.git && cd agent-cube && ./install.sh
```

**Use:**
Point Cursor at `AGENT_CUBE.md` + `cube --help`, tell it where your specs are, watch it go! 🚀
